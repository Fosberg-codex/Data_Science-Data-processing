## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```
 
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
data
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

data %>%
 filter(carat >= 0.62 & carat <= 3.02) %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes(x = carat, y = price) +
 geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1.5, colour = "#B27F22") +
 labs(title = "View of diamonds") +
 theme_minimal()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
